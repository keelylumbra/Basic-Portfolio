<h1>About Me</h1>
</header>


<section>
<p>My name is Keely Lumbra and I am a proud student of the UCF Coding Boot Camp. I graduated from UCF in 2014 with
two bachelors degrees - one in Political Science and another in Psychology. I am not using either degree and instead have developed 
a career as a professional server for Yard House Orlando.</p>
<p>One may not think professional serving is a fruitful career, but little do they know. 
I mostly get paid cash money to talk to people, eat free food, and learn about craft beer all day. 
I even get to keep my clothes on. It will be a tough transition going into programming - 
where I hear you work without pants on the majority of the day.
